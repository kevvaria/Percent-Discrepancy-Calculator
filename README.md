# Percent-Discrepancy-Calculator

The motivation behind this project stems form my Physics class where we would have to constantly calculate the Percent Discrepancy for multiple tests in each lab.

This calculator simplifies the process by saving time and providing accurate results to the expected sig-fig.

Additionally, this project also includes support for calculating the percent difference for any given test.

The user is expected to know the measured value and the expected value.
